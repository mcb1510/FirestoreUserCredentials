# Overview

This is a program that will allow the user to create,log in, and manage an an account. It will store the user's information in a database.

I created this program to demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data into Firestore using Python.


Here is a video link of me explaining how this program works.

# Cloud Database

I am using Firestore, which is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud.

My database has a collection of users. They will be organized by an unique ID which will be the username of the account. Each user will have a name, ID number, password, birthdate year, and date and time of the last logged in session. 

# Development Environment

* Python 3.10.4
* Firestore/Firebase
* Git / GitHub

# Future Work
